Its a best practice to either pull from the main branch to get latest updates to main branch.

OR

Pull "upstream" of the branch you are creating. Important because version of the main branch on your computer needs to be up to date with the main branch on GitHub.

                                                name of the new branch follows the -b

Successfull branch creation will return :    Switched to a new branch 'Simple_Leaflet_Map'
